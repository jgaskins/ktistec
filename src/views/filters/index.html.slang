  | By default, filter terms match the <em>entire content</em> of a
    post <em>exactly</em>. Filter terms support wildcards "_" and "%".
    Wildcard "_" matches any single character and wildcard "%" matches
    zero or more consecutive characters. To match a <em>single</em>
    percent character use "\\%". To match a <em>single</em> underscore
    use "\\_". As an example, to match the word "term" found anywhere
    inside the content of a post, use "%term%".
